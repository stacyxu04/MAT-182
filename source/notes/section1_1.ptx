        A <term>sequence</term> is a function whose domain is a consecutive set of integers.
        The elements of the domain are called <term>indices</term> while the corresponding elements of the target are called <term>terms</term>.
     </p>
 
      <example> 
            <m>f: \{0,1,2\} \to \mathbb{R} \text{ given by } f_0=20, f_1=30, \text{ and } f_2=50</m>
      </example>

      <example>
      <m>f: \{1,2,3,\dots\} \to \mathbb{R} \text{ given by } f_n = \frac{1}{n^{2}}</m>

      Properties of Sequences:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A sequence is <term> increasing </term> if each term is greater than the one before it.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            A sequence is <term> non-decreasing </term> if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it.
          </p>

        Special Types of Sequences:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              A <term> geometric sequence </term> is a sequence in which each term after the initial term is obtained by <alert> multiplying </alert> the previous term by a fixed number called the <alert> common ratio </alert>.
            </p> 

            <example>
              <p>  
                The geometric sequence with initial term <m> a_0 = 2 </m> and common ratio <m> r=3 </m>
                has terms <m> a_0 = 2, a_1 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6, a_2= 6 \cdot 3 = 18, a_3 = 18 \cdot 3 = 54, \dots </m>, where each subsequent term is obtained from the previous term by multiplying by 3.
              </p>
              </example>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              An <term> arithmetic sequence </term> is a sequence in which each term after the initial term is obtained by <alert> adding </alert> a fixed number called the <alert> common difference </alert> to the previous term.
            </p> 

            <example>
              <p>  
                The arithmetic sequence with initial term <m> a_0 = 2 </m> and common difference <m> r=3 </m>
                has terms <m> a_0 = 2, a_1 = 2+3 = 5, a_2= 5+3 = 8, a_3 = 8+3 = 11, \dots </m>, where each subsequent term is obtained by adding 3 to the previous term.
